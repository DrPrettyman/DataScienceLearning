# Data Science Projects

I'm just doing a few exercises to remind myself of the basics.

## Types of Machine Learning Systems

### Supervised Learning

- Classification
    - Naive Bayes
    - KNN
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forests
        - Boosting
        - Bootstrapping

- Regression
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machines

### Unsupervised Learning

- Clustering
    - K-Means
    - DBSCAN
    - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis

- Anomaly Detection
    - One-class SVM
    - Isolation Forest

- Association Rule Learning
    - Apriori
    - Eclat

- Dimensionality Reduction
    - PCA
    - Kernel PCA
    - Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
    - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE)
